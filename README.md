# Credit Risk Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict credit risk using a Kaggle dataset. It showcases my abilities and skills in data science, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Overview

Credit risk prediction is crucial for financial institutions to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project uses an ANN to classify credit risks as either good or bad based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various features related to borrowers' financial history and personal information.

**Key Steps**

## Data Preprocessing:

* Handling missing values
* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature scaling

## Model Building:

* Constructing an ANN with input, hidden, and output layers
* Selecting appropriate activation functions

## Training:

* Splitting the data into training and testing sets
* Compiling the model with loss function and optimizer
* Training the model on the training set

## Evaluation:

* Evaluating the model's performance on the test set
* Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Deployment:

Using the model for making predictions on new data

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow

## Results

The ANN model achieves significant performance metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting credit risk. Detailed results, including plots and evaluation metrics, can be found in the notebook.
